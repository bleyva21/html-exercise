        <h2>Cities Lived In</h2>
        <p>I was born in Miami and lived there until I moved to Denver with my father. I lived in Denver throughout middle and high school. A few years after finishing highschool my family moved to Stuart and eventually I moved in with them. Once there I alternated between living in both Stuart and Cape Coral until eventually joining the military. Sometime into the military I was stationed in Ramstein, where I currently live.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Miami</li>
            <li>Denver</li>
            <li>Stuart</li>
            <li>Cape Coral</li>
            <li>Ramstein</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Cities Yet to Visit</h2>
        <p>These locations are all very places I've always wanted to visit. For Paris and London it is mainly because I enjoy the feeling of being in a big city.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Rome</li>
            <li>Paris</li>
            <li>London</li>
